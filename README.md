# SentenceDecoderGame
This program is a sentence decoder game in which the program reads a file and chooses a
random sentence from that file. Once it chooses that sentence it then encodes the specified
sentence using a permuted alphabet. The program then outputs the sentence and constantly asks 
the user if they would like to guess one letter, or the entire sentence. Once the user has had 
enough letters revealed to guess the entire sentence, their number of correct and incorrect 
guesses are displayed on the screen and they are given the option to play again.
